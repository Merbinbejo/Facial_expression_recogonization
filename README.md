# Facial_expression_recogonization

This project implements a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model. The application detects faces in images and predicts facial expressions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, and Neutral.

The system is built as an interactive Streamlit web application, allowing users to upload images and instantly view predicted facial expressions with bounding box visualization.
